Dear Lord,

Thank you for new beginnings. Today I give you everything over to you. Thank you for taking away my worries yesterday, so it doesn't steal my joy and peace of today. May this new month bring clarity & focus on what you have in stored for me. I will prioritize what's important & not worry about anything I can't control or even things I think I have control. I'm determined to fix my eyes on you & allow myself to walk at your pace of grace and match my pace of life to Yours.
